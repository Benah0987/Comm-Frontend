Process:

The inception of Comm began shortly after an enlightening interview experience where I recognized the need to enhance my communication skills. This realization led me to research communication improvement techniques, during which I discovered Vinh Giang, a renowned speaker and communication coach. Inspired by Giang's methods and teachings, I decided to build a platform that not only served as a personal tool for improving communication but also assisted others with similar goals. The development journey involved designing the architecture and user experience to be as interactive and insightful as possible. The main challenges I encountered were integrating real-time video feedback mechanisms and ensuring user-friendly navigation. However, overcoming these hurdles significantly improved my problem-solving and development skills, ultimately leading to the creation of a versatile video review and analysis web application.

Learnings:

JWT Authentication: Mastered the use of JWT for managing user sessions, a challenge I had faced in previous projects. This involved securely generating and validating tokens to handle user authentication and session management.
File Uploads: Developed skills in handling file uploads from user devices, addressing challenges such as file size limitations and format support, enhancing the robustness of backend media processing.
Error Handling: Improved error handling and user feedback mechanisms, learning to provide clear, immediate responses to user actions, especially in scenarios involving file uploads and authentication errors
Frontend-Backend Integration: Deepened understanding of integrating frontend and backend functionalities seamlessly, ensuring smooth communication between the two layers and enhancing overall application performance.
User Experience Optimization: Learned techniques for optimizing user experience, including intuitive interface design and responsive feedback mechanisms, to create a more engaging and user-friendly application.

+ Improvement that can be done :

AI-Driven Analysis: Incorporate artificial intelligence to automate video and audio analysis, reducing the need for manual review and enhancing the speed and accuracy of feedback.
Scalability Enhancements: Improve the infrastructure to handle larger volumes of video uploads and simultaneous user access, ensuring the platform remains responsive and efficient as the user base grows.
Advanced Search Features: Implement more sophisticated search capabilities, such as filtering by specific video content, user comments, or analytical insights, to help users find relevant content more efficiently.
Mobile Optimization: Develop a mobile-friendly version or a dedicated mobile app to increase accessibility and convenience for users on mobile devices.
Interactive Video Features: Introduce features such as clickable timestamps in video comments and annotations, allowing users to interact more dynamically with video content.
